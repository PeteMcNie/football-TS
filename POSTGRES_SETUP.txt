<!-- POSTGRES SETUP

1. In terminal: npm i pg pg-hstore sequelize sequelize-cli
2. In terminal: touch .sequelizerc (creates a file called .sequelizerc)
3. In .sequelizerc add code seen in the file in this project (you are defining the path to the database files)
4. In terminal: npx sequelize init (creates the config, migrations, models and seeders files)
5. Alter config.js file, (in this project, server/db/config/config.js):
 - url: you will define this in .env file
 - dialect: the db you are using
 - username: the username you have defined in the .env file
 - password: the password you have defined in the .env file
 - database: what we will call our DB
 - host and port: use defaults

6. In terminal use postgres: (you may need: brew install postgresql, then: brew services start postgresql) In terminal: psql postgres
7. To create a new postgres user: postgres=# CREATE ROLE me WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
8. To enable user 'me' to create a db: postgres=# ALTER ROLE me CREATEDB;
9. In terminal: \du (lists all users and roles)
10. To connect user with postgres, in terminal: psql -d postgres -U me (you will see new prompt in terminal: postgres=> instead of postgres=#)
NOTE: If stuck use commandline to check what DB you have and who the OWNER is to help debug

11. In terminal: createdb <db_name> -U <db_user> (creates a new db, eg. createdb horses -U me)
12. Now that you have created a db, link this to your project config file using a .env file
 - In terminal: touch .env
 - Add the url that will be called in the config file eg. DEV_DATABASE_URL=postgres://<db_user>:<db_password>@127.0.0.1:5432/<db_name>
 - NOTES: <db_user> = me, <db_password> = password, <db_name> = horses

13. To CREATE MODEL AND MIGRATION, in terminal: npx sequelize model:generate --name Matches --attributes homeTeam:string,awayTeam:string,winner:string       NOTE: No spaces as per example                  /
14. AT THIS POINT YOU MAY NEED TO ADD NOT_NULLABLE and FOREIGN KEYS etc          /
15. Once sorted, in terminal: npx sequelize db:migrate                         /
                                                                             /
16. To ADD SEED DATA, in terminal: npx sequelize seed:generate --name Matches
17. In seed files, add seed data, files have example of how to do this
18. In terminal: npx sequelize db:seed:all


This should create and seed the db for you, ready for calls. :-)
